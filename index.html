         <h2>What is SASS?</h2>
        <P>SASS or Syntactically awsome style its a CSS preprocessor which is used to reduce repetition with CSS
         and save time. It adds power and elegance to the basic language and facilitates you to add variables, 
         nested rules, mixins, inline imports, inheritance and more, all with fully CSS-compatible syntax.</P>

         <h2>Who is the inventor of SASS?</h2>
        <p>
         SASS was developed by Natalie Weizenbaum and was designed by Hampton Catlin. So, Hampton Catlin is
         credited as the designer of SASS, and he is also known as the father of SASS.
        </p>

         <h2>Why SASS?</h2>
        <p>The SASS is useful in reducing the usage of CSS which will reduce the time and saves the code that in turn
         increases code reusability and reduces code redundancy. It provides own syntax for the CSS provides in 
         developing more efficient code. SASS is a superset of CSS which is easier to use and it contains all the features of CSS</p>

         <h2>What are the reasons behind using SASS?</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>You can write codes easily and efficiently, and they are easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It is a pre-processing language which provides its syntax for CSS.</li>
            <li>It is a superset of CSS which contains all the features of CSS and is an open source pre-processor, coded in Ruby.</li>
            <li>It is more stable and powerful CSS extension and style documents more clearly and structurally.</li>
            <li>It facilitates reusability methods, logic statements and some of the built-in functions like color manipulation, mathematics, and parameter lists item.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Which data types does the Sass Script supports?</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Boolean (true or false)</li>
            <li>Number (1, 5, 13, 10px)</li>
            <li>Nulls</li>
            <li>Colors (red, #FF0000)</li>
            <li>Text String, without quote ("foo", "bar")</li>
            <li>List of values that are separated by commas or space (2.0em, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica)</li>
            <li>Maps from one value to another value (key 1: value 1, key 2: value 2)</li>
            <li>Function reference.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>What is the difference between Sass and CSS? </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sass is a CSS pre-processor with syntax advancements and an extension of CSS3</li>
                <li>Sass has two syntax</li>
                <li>The first syntax is “SCSS” and it uses the .scss extension</li>
                <li>The other syntax is indented syntax or just “Sass” and it uses the .sass extension</li>
                <li>While Sass has loose syntax with white space and no semicolons, the SCSS resembles more to CSS</li>
            </ul>

         <h2>Variables</h2>
           <p>Sass variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with $, and then you can refer
            to that name instead of the value itself. But despite their simplicity, they're one of the most useful 
            tools Sass brings to the table. Variables make it possible to reduce repetition, do complex math, configure libraries, 
            and much more.</p>

         <h2> Nasting in SASS</h2>
         <p>Nesting is combining of different logic structures. Using SASS, we can combine multiple CSS rules within one another. 
            If you are using multiple selectors, then you can use one selector inside another to create compound selectors.</p>

         <h2>SASS Inheritance/Extend</h2>
         <p>In Sass, @extend is used to share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It is a very important and useful feature of Sass.
            The @extend feature of Sass allows classes to share a set of properties with one another. In complicated CSS where many 
            classes are put together, duplication of properties may occurs. The @extend features makes your code less and facilitates you to rewrite it repeatedly.</p>

         <h2>Mixins in SASS</h2>
         <p>Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.</p>
